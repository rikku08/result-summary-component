## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I have learned that I have a long way to go with coding HTML and CSS. I have studied how HTML elements and CSS properties works thru examples. But I still find it a challenge when I'm trying to start making my own project. I keep on searching for inspiration on how to design and make a website. The result is I'm not able to practice coding more and do anything done. I feel with this challenges I can focus more on coding more instead of thinking and planning about the design. 

With this challenge I was able to learn Github as well, how to make a repository, upload it and publish the challenge that I have created.


### Continued development


I will focus more on coding HTML and CSS to improve my skills with the challenges available in Frontend Mentor. While doing JavaScript lesson on freecodecamp.org

### Useful resources
